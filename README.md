This Project’s aim is to take you take you closer to learning, guide you to the path way of becoming a great software developer. Show the bootcamps closer to you, courses to take, and a place for an interactive platform to socialise with your fellow dev friends & trainers.

We'll introduce you to the modern technologies you need for full stack web development, and by the end of our programme you will be able to build applications and prototypes - independently and in teams.

This project continues to pressure companies to strengthen their employer brand and to offer compelling compensation as well as expand their talent pool into new markets.

The demand for software engineers is simply not slowing down. We’ve run out of ways to describe how much it’s increasing. Digital transformation may sound like a buzzword, but as more of the planet arrives online, as business owners become more creative and explore new distribution channels – as our lives evolve, we need software engineers.
To get the best and brightest minds on your team, get to know what they’re looking for, what drives them, and where they are.
We’re here to help.

## Introduction

Purpose
The demand for software engineers continues to accelerate as competition for talent heats up. In fact, software engineers on Hired received more than twice the average amount of interview requests in 2021 than in 2020.

As expected, the pandemic shelter-in-place and work-from-home policies continue to expand opportunities for remote tech workers to pursue roles (and salaries) outside of their current location or cost of living standards. While Canada and the UK are catching up, the US continues to offer the most competitive salaries on average. But things are changing in the big tech hubs as workers relocate for various reasons and companies rethink how necessary it is to be in the office.
For data on the top markets and those seeing the most growth.
Industry/ domain
Anywhere computers are used there are software engineers hard at work; software engineers are working in almost every field of endeavor.
Here are a few
Aerospace -- Boeing, SpaceX, NASA, AirBnB, ESA, JSA, etc,
Machine Automation
Medicine/Healthcare
Law enforcement/military
Non-technical academia
Public safety
Business in general
Education (not the same as academia)\
Entertainment

This project will provide everything they need to know and guide them every step of the way.

## Stakeholders

Junior dev is what this programs for, to make the people who doesn’t know anything much of the Software Engineering, and make them love it,
Dev schools is one of the key stakeholders of this projects, as it is their way to reach the students.
This is for Trainers who want to want teach too.
Also, experts are welcome too. There are always room for learning.

## Open Questions/Out of Scope

Building the entire frontend.
Additional Features
CHAT
“CLUB”
Deploy server to Digital Ocean

Non-functional Requirements

## Securities:

Encrypt passwords and reset tokens
Prevent cross site scripting - XSS
Prevent NoSQL injections
Add a rate limit for requests of 100 requests per 10 minutes
Protect against http param polution
Add headers for security (helmet)
Use cors to make API public (for now)

• How easy to use does the software need to be?
The app doesn’t need to be as easy as it expects computer/technology savvy users/trainers.
• How quickly should the application respond to user requests?
Will be collecting user feedbacks and apply them as time goes.

• How reliable must the application be? (e.g. mean time between failures)
Needs to be fetching datas from the sources and passing them to users as much as possible.

•Does the software conform to any technical standards to ease maintainability?

### [Design Study](https://www.figma.com/file/tZXvOHsfeq4e128I4Mdr0I/THE-CODE-COACH-PROJECT?node-id=0%3A1&t=cyO2mkqkP8JE4b4Y-1)

### Project Planning

Include a Gantt chart or screenshot of a Trello board showing key milestones (with dates) to complete the project.

### Testing Strategy

What were steps undertaken to achieve product quality?
Using Postman for my testing.
How was each feature of the application tested?
Backend been tested well.
How did you handle edge cases?
Will still work on that. Did not get to its final version.
